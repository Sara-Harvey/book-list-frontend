# Two-Minute Media
They say that any emotion only lasts for two minutes. The Two-Minute Media app gives the user the option to read or listen to a short fun or interesting story, or to have one chosen from the API at random.

The backend repo is here: https://github.com/Sara-Harvey/two-min-media-api, 
and the API is live on Heroku, here: https://two-min-media-api.herokuapp.com/stories.
